# Text Similarity Analyzer 
## By Matthew Keeran
written in python 3.5.4 on Windows 8.1. Tested with python 3.6 on Ubuntu 16.
### Instructions
Runs via python text_analysis.py followed by two .txt files, a source and a target file.
I personally pipe the output to a text file, then enter the file names one by one followed by enter.	

python text_analysis.py > output.txt

pepper-src.txt

pepper-tgt.txt

### Input 1
A starting sequence of words or letters.
### Input 2
An ending sequence of words or letters.
### Output
Tokenizes and produces optimal alignments of sequence of strings starting with input 1, listing the steps required to turn into input 2.
